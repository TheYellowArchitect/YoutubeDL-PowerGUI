# YoutubeDL-PowerGUI
With this program, you can download any video, music, playlist, channel, out of any site!
All accessible to the most casual of users (ol' grandma), while at the same time, power users who want to have the job done within 3 button presses

## Downloads
  ### Windows
  Just unzip it, annoying installation bloat doesn't exist here
	I heavily suggest looking into #optimal-setup.
	So you can press F9, to start it from anywhere!
  
  ### Linux
  Linux Chads build pipes, they don't use GUI (kappa?)
  
## Why not use an online converter?
  - There is not a single online converter which can download entire playlists or channels.
  - They also are slower, as they download the video on their servers, then you download it from their servers. What happens here is you download it straight to your computer, the middle man is cut, and you won't have to wait **even a second** anymore!  
  No waiting for the download button -_-
  - You have to open your browser and trade advertisements or cookies, to download any video...
  
## What is a PowerGUI
Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) were made for casual users. This means making a program accessible, but losing functionality (which very few users need so it's widely acceptable)
A PowerGUI is a GUI which has not lost any feature, any depth. Why? Because the advanced features are for advanced features, and these features exist to make their usage more efficient. In short, an advanced user **spends less time** with the program, to do the same task a casual user would.

You, as a user, want to get your job done, the program is merely your tool to getting it done. Pressing keys, or clicking buttons, the goal is finishing a task. No one interacts with a program for interaction's sake, and so, the less time you spend with it, the better. Power users spend the less possible time to finish their task, however small.

This program, is accessible, but being a PowerGUI, over time of usage will make you a power user, organically.
Here is an example of an advanced usage, coming up organically:
- Let's say on the 12th playlist you download, one video is removed from youtube. All other "competitors" will crash there, maybe one will skip the video.
If you search other software how to ignore removed videos, **there is literally no solution** - what are you going to do, touch the code? lmao
Here? You search https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#options and just write
`-i` or `--ignore-errors` and then put your playlist.
- Let's say you want to download a channel, from the date 31/12/20 and before. How are you going to do that? **There is literally no solution** on other programs, meant for casual usage. No advanced user is born overnight, such needs come up organically. So, you search https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#options and just write  `--datebefore 31/12/20`

Look at the CHOICES you are given! https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#options
You may not use them, but you CAN use them when you need them.

### Customization
And let's say you want to download the thumbnail of every video you download, maybe it has a cool meme?
`--write-all-thumbnails [YourVideoURL]` and press that mysterious Custom Button, and name it "Thumbnails"

Now, every video you input, once you press that button, automatically downloads thumbnails atop the video!
  
### Keyboard Usage
Hotkeys - direct keyboard usage - makes your usage faster, and hence, finishing faster your task.
Download Video/Music/Custom1/Custom2/Custom3/Custom4 are mapped on Ctrl+1/2/3/4/5
You can also use tab, but honestly who uses that anymore? Mouses exist, but anyway, for accessibility, tab usage is complete as well, to ensure full usage of the software by exclusively using a keyboard, just like its fully usable by exclusively using a mouse.

Ultimately, the goal of this program, is to get users to finish their tasks, on the less possible time. To become power users, without **ever** reading documentation or experimenting around. Because in the end of the day, a tool usable by all is good, but improving based on the user's powers and requirements - **that** is the ultimate tool.
  
## Why not use other youtube video downloaders? They look prettier!
  - Other video downloaders purely download onto .mp4 and .mp3, and are made exclusively for casual use. **This is made for both casual users and power users.**
  A casual us
  
### On an entirely different level!
Honestly, the fact you can press 3 buttons
`ctrl+C (video URL) -> F9 (shortcut boot) -> Enter`
to download any video - finishing your task instantly by the time you press them - is something other "competitors" will **never** touch, and their users will be troubled by clicking buttons all day and exploring their directory instead lmao  
And even if they really reach this level of efficiency, they will **never** have as many choices https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#options as this program.     They will be pretty but they will never become a PowerGUI. The opposite, however, is possible.
