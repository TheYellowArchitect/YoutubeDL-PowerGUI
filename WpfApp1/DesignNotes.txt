TODO List:

	Alongside the github stuff, do a full testing of the final zip
	And make LOTS OF GIFS!
	
	GIFs plz, e.g. access keys, tabs (to show it can be used fully by keyboard, and by mouse or a mix)
	^Show it with the 3 example videos. Definitely Seth on the background.
	E.g. the key-presses
	
	Gif 1: Unzipping from Downloads, and leaving it there
		Text: "You can put it anywhere you want. The best location is in Program Files"
		Opening the software and then showing how it works, by browsing on the background on internet historian vids, right-click copy link location
		Alt-Tab on show, then show pressing Enter
		
	Gif 2: Show normal usage of a normie, on a youtube site, copy-pasting the URL on top, by browsing and opening it by mouse.
	Optimal Setup
		Gif 3: Show normal usage of a power user, wanting to download a video
		Has it on "Program Files", create bottom shortcut on F9

	Release:		
		
		[]The Competition 
			https://github.com/MrS0m30n3/youtube-dl-gui
			https://github.com/axcore/tartube
		[]Build Options will be weird for sure lel, gotta bundle it in a single .exe!
			Seems like the final project folder will literally be the YoutubeDLGUI.exe, next to youtube-dl.exe ((so it won't have to search it))?
		^"The exe throws an error due to missing MSVCR100.dll
			To run the exe you need to install first the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)."
			Gotta bundle it somehow!
		
		[]Put yellow architect icon on your profile ;)
		
		1.0 -> Give on README:
			Downloads:
				Windows: [link here]
				Just unzip it, annoying installation bloat doesn't exist here
				I heavily suggest looking into #optimal-setup.
				So you can press F9, to start it from anywhere!
				Linux: Linux Chads build pipes, they don't use GUI (kappa?)
				//Dont even mention Mac
				
				If it doesn't work, it is because your Windows does not have Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555], or .NET Framework 4.6[https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net46-offline-installer]
		
			Why not use an online converter?
				//**There is not a single online converter which can download entire playlists or channels.
					//Muh customisation all in all is trash
					//And its also slower since vids downloaded by server, then by you, instead of directly by you.
				Muh playlist
				Muh channel download
				Muh custom commands of youtubeDL (e.g. you can download youtube's subtitles and description)
				Muh privacy
				Muh shortcuts and customization (saving commands)
				^Like, you can press F9 -> Enter, and you have downloaded your video. (redirect to optimal setup)
				Compare this with the chore of opening an entire browser, using a search engine to write youtube converter, hope it has no malware, paste the link (not done for you automatically), click enter, await a few years for their servers to boot it up, then atop of that, instead of already having it in your pc, you have to click download and wait.
				
					//Above put muh all sites download not just youtube! https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html
				
				Just cut the middle person and begone with this bloat!
		
			Muh commands
				Link to list
			
			What is a PowerGUI?
				blabla muh accessibility without losing any depth
				muh end goal is not appealing to normies, but making every user, spend the less possible time with the program. To make everyone a power user, organically.
				
				"So yeah, its both a command prompt and a GUI, in the same place :)"
				"An accessible command prompt. If this was Linux, imagine the pipe building..." (Linux for around 1.0)
			Optimal Setup
				Muh shortcut on desktop (F9)
					Muh Shortcuts (Ctrl1/5)
					Muh renaming to put _ to become access key (muh Alt)
					Muh tab button
				
			Why I made this -> On its own .txt, not at github front page plz.
				"::While I hope no1 else uses this script, I have to mention why I made this.
				::Everytime I want to see a mere url, I have to go start menu -> cmd -> cd .. -> cd .. -> cd program files (x86) -> cd youtubeDL -> (open notepad++ and find the fucking command to copypaste) -> paste the command and copypaste the URL.
				::I have downloaded over 500 videos this way... I tried to make a GUI using Visual Studio, but Visual Studio crashed permanently and had to be uninstalled. (also fuck telemetry, so, good riddance)
				::I wanted to make the closest to GUI, something to win time, you click it, you click a button (in this case, a number), paste the url and done. Close to GUI ;)"
				^Expand this
				
			Common Errors
				Try updating
				Then explain muh 403 https://ostechnix.com/fix-unable-to-download-video-data-http-error-403-forbidden-error/ to write

			"Personal Disclaimer: This program is what you should expect from an 1.0 release. Functional, without bugs, while also covering all its users' needs (powerusers, mouse users, keyboard users). No more core functionality will ever be added, as there is nothing to add. No updates will be released, breaking stuff, as all the core functionality is **COMPLETE** (Kinda sad I have to stress this out, the state of software quality nowadays is below garbage) 
			
			I could be hit by a train, and it should function perfectly even 5 years from now (as long youtube-dl.exe works)
			
			However, I plan to maintain it, and add misc features, like Localisation!"
			
			Muh license at the end, muh GPL v3, put name of creator too (you, real name included)
			
			Muh competition, somewhere above "Why use this video downloader, instead of others? They look prettier!"
				YoutubeDLGUI
					Explain its trash because you cannot input anything which passes directly to youtube-dl.exe, aka options.
					No console log either
					Formats predefined kek
					No shortcuts or clipboard copy-paste to enter.
				YoutubeVidDownloader
					Cringe hugeass bloat
					Cant download multiple at once
					No shortcuts or clipboard copy-paste to enter.
					((Can you even download another process entirely at the same time?))
				https://vidd.ly/
					This is the peak example of what the PowerGUI was born for.
					Given that program's functionality, a user will NEVER use any advanced features, because he CANNOT use any advanced features.
					If he wants any other option (e.g. --write-all-thumbnails), the difficulty curve will be so high (open cmd, cd.. there, and write the commands) to the point he will straight up give up. He will never achieve the most optimal and effortless usage of the simple task he wants. To download videos, in 2 buttons.

Future:
	Major:
		[]Localisation
			^muh tooltips (of english)
			Nea Ellinika Binteo/Kineikones
			Ancient Greek Kineikones
		[]TextBlock for console Log to become TextBox so you can copy that stuff and paste it ((but ofc you cant write there!)
		[]If ffmpeg is not detected at launch, video's --format mp4 becomes vanilla, and audio's double argument becomes --best-audio
		[]Output-Related (look into -o for exporting data?)
			[*]Description:
				--write-description -> Write video description to a .description file (description for boolean ftw!)

				^Thumbnail view boolean box plz.
			[*]Change format?
				--merge-output-format FORMAT     If a merge is required (e.g. bestvideo+bestaudio), output to given container format. One of mkv, mp4, ogg,    webm, flv. Ignored if no merge is required

										 containing directory.
				^Perhaps also get ffmpeg next to youtube-dl.exe? -> https://www.ffmpeg.org/

	Minor:
		[]Have lots of dataGridColumnHeaders, e.g. Video Upload Date(, Video Views)
		[]Double click a selected element, should open the file (VLC pog!)
		Right click a selected element should open the file location and select the file
		[]For error output and stuff (e.g. press -U to update), either make details inside the data grid, which is easy
        https://www.wpf-tutorial.com/datagrid-control/details-row/
        and closeable with X? -> This should give the normal youtube-dl output.

Held Notes:

	Async/Multithreading POG EXAMPLE:
		private void button1_MouseEnter(object sender, MouseEventArgs e)
		{
			BackgroundWorker worker = new BackgroundWorker();
			worker.DoWork += delegate
			{
				for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
				{
					this.Dispatcher.Invoke((Action)(() => { btn.Content = Convert.ToString(i); }));
					System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(1000);
				}                
			};
			worker.RunWorkerCompleted += delegate { tekst.Text = "Mouse Enter"; };
			worker.RunWorkerAsync();
		}
